/**
 * The RIFE instrumentation agent will modify the bytecode of the classes
 * that are loaded to provide new capabilities that are otherwise provided by
 * the class-loader.
 * <p>To activate the agent you need to execute the Java application with the
 * proper argument, for example:
 * <pre>java -javaagent:/path/to/rife-agent-1.6-jdk15.jar com.your.mainClass</pre>
 * <p>When the agent is active the class-loader will automatically be disabled
 * to ensure that they are not conflicting with each other. The agent is
 * packaged in its own jar file which should correspond to the RIFE version
 * that you are using in your application.
 * <p>Note that this agent doesn't entirely replace the functionality of the
 * class-loader, during development mode you might want to make use of the
 * automatic re-compilation of classes that is only provided by the
 * class-loader. However, during production the agent is the recommended
 * choice.
