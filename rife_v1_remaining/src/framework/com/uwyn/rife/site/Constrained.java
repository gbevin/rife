/**
 * This interface defines methods for bean-centric constraining of data
 * entities.
 * <p>A constraint describes additional information about a data entity. Its
 * main purpose is to alter the default behaviour of a data type and to
 * clearly set the accepted limits. The meta-data that's provided through
 * constraints can be used elsewhere to gather more information about how to
 * correctly integrate the indicated data limits.
 * <p>For example, a constraint specifies that a certain text's length is
 * limited to 30 characters, parts of the system can query this information
 * and act accordingly:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a HTML form builder can create a field that doesn't allow the entry of
 * longer text,
 * <li>a SQL query builder can limit the size of the column in which the text
 * will stored when the table creation SQL is generated,
 * <li>a validation system can check if the text isn't longer than 30
 * characters and provide appropriate information when the length is exceeded.
 * </ul>
 * <p>There are two types of constraints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>those that are related to the entire bean (<code>ConstrainedBean</code>
 * constraints)
 * <li>those that only apply to a single property (<code>ConstrainedProperty</code>
 * constraints)
 * </ul>
